# Building-an-On-Premises-Active-Directory-and-Splunk-Lab

- I'm in the midst of building this homelab
- This lab involves setting up an on-premises Active Directory domain environment and integrating it with Splunk for monitoring. It includes creating and configuring AD components like users, groups, and policies, as well as installing and configuring Splunk to collect and analyze security logs from the domain controllers.
